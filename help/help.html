		<h1>beePen help</h1>
		
		beePen is a Python plugin for drawing freeand annotations and sketches in an ad-hoc layer in QGis. 
		It is inspired by the corresponding tool in <a href="http://www.beegis.org/" target="_blank">BeeGIS</a>
		and re-use the code by Pavol Kapusta in his Frehand Editing plugin.<br />
		<br />
		
		The plugin window is started by the "beePen" command (Fig. 1).<br /><br />

		beePen allows to create an annotation layer, that is characterized by three fields, storing the user-defined width (in map units), color and transparency of the pen. 
		These value are automatically inserted based on the user choice in the plugin window (Fig. 2).<br />

		<br /><br /><br />
		To draw annotations, create a new annotation layer from the beePen window (see Fig. 2) or load a previous one, put in edit mode using the standard tool of QGis 
		(command at the left in Fig. 3) and then draw after selecting the pen tool (rightmost command in Fig. 3).<br />

		The conception of beePen is by Mauro Dedonatis (Urbino Univ., Italy), while the implementation is by Mauro Alberti.</div>
